[*moja global*](http://moja.global/) is a collaboration under the Linux Foundation that aims for the widest possible use of credible tools to better manage the land sector. The flagship software is the 
 [Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT)](#FLINTpara), 
a tool to estimate emissions and sinks of greenhouse gasses from forestry and agriculture.  

### Why moja global?  

Climate change is the biggest challenge of our time. Globally, more than 25% of the greenhouse gasses emissions are caused by the land use, mainly agriculture and forestry. But plants are also the easiest way to take CO2 out of the atmosphere again. So  while land use is now part of the problem, we want to make it part of the solution. Before we can better plan and monitor land management, we have to start with better measurements.   

Measuring emissions and sinks from land use is notoriously difficult and developing tools to estimate these sinks and emissions is expensive and requires specialised expertise. Through global collaboration between scientists and coders, moja global reduces the cost and increase the quality of the software that can estimate emissions and sinks from land use.  


## FLINT<a name="FLINTpara"></a>

The Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) is a C++ framework that combines satellite and ground data in ways that meet policy needs. It is based on over 20 years of experience building and operating integration tools in Australia and Canada.  

### Why FLINT?

The FLINT makes developing and operating advanced systems achievable by all countries. It is a generic platform with a modular structure, allowing countries to attach any variety of models or data to build country-specific systems. The platform handles complex computer science tasks, such as the storage and processing of large data sets, leaving users to focus on monitoring, reporting and scenario analyses.  

### How is FLINT different from earlier integrating tools?

The FLINT is using the lessons learned from first generation tools, to build a new framework that meets present and future needs. The key improvements compared to the first generation tools include:
+ a flexible, modular approach, allowing for country specific implementations from [IPCC Tier 1 to 3 ](https://www.reddcompass.org/mgd-content-v1/dita-webhelp/en/Box1.html)
+ support for [wall-to-wall, sample based, jurisdictional, and supply chain approaches](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5896200f414fb57d26f3d600/t/59362b028419c2db8f57e747/1496722191543/REDD_nested_projects.pdf)
+ the ability to cover all [land uses and land use changes, and activity-based reporting such as REDD+](https://theredddesk.org/what-redd)
+ scenario analysis systems to allow the development of projections
+ the potential to be used for multiple other purposes, including economics, water and biodiversity
+ development managed using a true open source approach under [moja global](http://moja.global), which will allow users (countries, companies and organisations) to direct strategy and control the budget.
+ software that allows data processing on local desktops or cloud-based systems   


## How to use FLINT?  

In the section ["Build Environments"] TO BE ADDED, you can find out how to install FLINT on your computer. FLINT can be configured to ingest any type of input data. This requires some understanding of the code and the modules. Feel free to play around or to ask for explanation through info@moja.global. If you would like to use FLINT in your institution or company, support from other institutions and companies is available from training courses to software as a service (SaaS).
